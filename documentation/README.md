Video Tutorial URL: https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfony

Feel dangerous with Symfony 7! This tutorial teaches the fundamentals, the how and why while building a real-life web application.

Symfony 7, yes! If you're ready to get serious about web dev - whether you're building a JSON API or a rich web app - you've come to the right place! Symfony is the famous backbone for the most popular PHP libraries, embraces object-oriented best practices and... it's just fun to use!

I want you to feel dangerous with Symfony and love the process! In this tutorial, we get to learn the fundamentals of Symfony, build real stuff and learn the how and why behind how things work. And... we'll do it by building a space-themed site (because I'm a sci-fi geek):

What you will be learning
1. Create a new (and tiny!) Symfony app (it's lean but mean)
2. Set up a local web server with the symfony binary
3. Get your editor (PHPStorm) + plugins primed for Symfony
4. Dive into Symfony Flex & the "recipes" system
5. Add some 3rd party packages and bundles
6. Routes, controllers and Responses!
7. The mighty bin/console tool
8. Head-first into Twig & templating
9. Your new favorite debugging tool: the web debug toolbar
10. Simple, but crazy-powered CSS & JS setup with AssetMapper!
11. Install & Running Tailwind CSS
12. Intro into Stimulus & Turbo for JavaScript & an SPA (single page app) feel
13. Create a JSON API endpoint
14. All-important "service objects": a quick tour of using them and creating your own
15. Say hello to MakerBundle
